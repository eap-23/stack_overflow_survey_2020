I created this report as a fun way to dig in and interact with some of the 2020 data made public for download under the Open Database License (ODbL) by Stack Overflow. 

Please note that survey data was taken in February 2020, before COVID-19 was declared a pandemic by the World Health Organization. 

Survey results can be found in the developer_survey_results folder of this repo or can be downloaded directly from Stack Overflow website below:
